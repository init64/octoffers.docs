In the realm of web automation and testing, Selenium stands out as a powerful suite of tools that supports browser automation,
enabling developers and testers to automate web browsers across different platforms. Drivers in Selenium act as a bridge between
a programming language and a web browser, allowing scripts to communicate with a browser as if a real user 
were navigating it. These drivers are essential components for executing automated tests or tasks on various web platforms. 
Here, we differentiate between two types of drivers: Open Source Drivers and Private Drivers.

### Supported Platforms

| Platform | Type    | Status            |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| Djinni   | Public  | Complete          |
| Indeed   | Private | Beta              |
| WorkBC   | Public  | Under Development |
| Monster  | Public  | Under Development |

### Open Source Drivers

Open Source Drivers are available to the general public and can be freely accessed, modified, and shared under 
their respective open-source licenses. These drivers support automation on popular web browsers like Chrome (through ChromeDriver), Firefox 
(via GeckoDriver), and others. Open Source Drivers are developed and maintained by a community of contributors who 
work collaboratively to improve the drivers and ensure compatibility with the latest browser versions. The open-source nature of these 
drivers fosters a transparent, collaborative environment where developers can contribute to the codebase, report issues, and suggest 
improvements. This widespread availability encourages experimentation and innovation, making it an invaluable resource for individuals and organizations looking 
to automate web interactions without the constraints of licensing fees or proprietary restrictions.

### Private Drivers

Private Drivers, on the other hand, are exclusive to specific groups or organizations, such as the Octoffers team members and their paid subscribers. These drivers are not publicly available and are often tailored to meet the 
specific needs or proprietary platforms of the organization. Private Drivers might offer advanced features, optimizations, or support 
for custom web elements that are not present in Open Source Drivers. Access to these drivers is restricted, 
and they may be distributed under proprietary licenses that limit their use to authorized users only. For organizations with 
unique requirements or those seeking competitive advantages, Private Drivers provide a customized solution that supports their specific automation tasks.
The exclusivity and specialized nature of Private Drivers make them a valuable asset for members and subscribers, enabling them 
to perform automated tasks more efficiently or interact with web platforms in ways that open-source alternatives might not support.
